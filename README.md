# Buser EA - Forex Trading Software

This is the code for Buser EA, a Forex trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to execute trades based on market analysis using moving averages and trend indicators. The software includes risk management and drawdown management parameters, as well as options for force open and auto lot size.

## Libraries and Dependencies

The code includes the necessary libraries and dependencies for the trade execution and market analysis. These include the Trade library for trade operations, the MovingAverages library for calculating moving averages, and the Trend library for determining the trend direction.

## Trade and Market Analysis Objects

The code initializes the trade object, as well as the market analysis tools - moving averages (ma) and trend (trend).

## Risk Management Parameters

Risk management parameters are defined to control the trade risk. The stop loss parameter specifies the maximum loss in pips allowed for a trade, while the take profit parameter specifies the desired profit in pips. The trailing stop parameter sets the trailing stop in pips.

## Drawdown Management Parameters

Drawdown management parameters are defined to limit the maximum drawdown as a fraction of the account balance. The maxDrawdown parameter specifies the maximum drawdown as a fraction of the account balance.

## Trading Parameters

Trading parameters are defined to configure the trading behavior. The forceOpen parameter is set to false, disabling the force open functionality. The autoLotSize parameter is set to true, enabling the auto lot size function. If auto lot size is deactivated, the fixedLotSize parameter is used to set a fixed lot size for trades.

## Trade Execution

The main function for trade execution is the OnTick() function. It checks if there is already an open trade for the current symbol. If not, it performs market analysis using the moving averages and trend indicators.

If the moving average value is positive and the trend direction is up, a buy trade is executed. The position size is calculated based on the account balance and risk tolerance. If the auto lot size function is deactivated, the fixed lot size is used. A trailing stop is set for the buy trade.

If the moving average value is negative and the trend direction is down, a sell trade is executed. The position size is calculated in the same way as for the buy trade, and a trailing stop is set for the sell trade.
